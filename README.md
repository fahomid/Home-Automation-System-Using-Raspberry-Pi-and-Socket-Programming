# Home Automation System Using Raspberry Pi and Socket Programming
  I built the complete Home automation system from scratch. It was for my Advanced Topic in Programming Language course. I used NodeJs and socket programming. In client site Python was used to connect the Pi with server. 
 
 # Requirements
  1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
  2. Mysql server
  3. NodeJs server
 
 # Back-end
  1. NodeJs
  2. NodeJs TCP socket
  3. Mysql server
 
 # Front-end
  1. Bootstrap 4
  2. Jquery
  
 # Client side (Raspberry Pi end)
  Used Python 3.5 to connect the Pi device with the server.
  
 # How to setup
  Use the db.sql file to setup the mysql database. Make sure you have 1337 and 8000 port open. Then simply put all the file in one directory and run the app.js script using node app.js command.
